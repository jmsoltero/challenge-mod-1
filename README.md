# Challenge 01

## Description


In this website the challenge was to alter the code in order to provide a more semantic and concise structure. This is done in order to have easier to read code and also to provide more descriptive tags for descriptive user accesibility tools such as screen readers.
This was a good practice for going over code line by line and deci[hering what every tag does and figuring out a way to organize it better.
